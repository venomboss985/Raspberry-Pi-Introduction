# Things to go over

- [ ] What is version control
  - [ ] git != GitHub
- [ ] What is git
- [ ] What is GitHub and why is it used
- [ ] Install and setup
  - [ ] `apt install git` (PiOS has it preinstalled, check with `which git` or `git --version`)
  - [ ] Download GitHub Desktop (not recommended)
  - [ ] "Sign in" with `git config --global user.name/user.email <username or email>`
  - [ ] If you need help use `git <command> --help` or `git help <command>` (`man` also works)
- [ ] Initialize a repository
  - [ ] `git init` in app folder (scp a basic calculator module)
  - [ ] Stage files with `git add -A` or `git add <filename>`
  - [ ] Check what is staged with `git status`
  - [ ] Remove files from stage with `git reset` or `git reset <filename>`
  - [ ] Once files are staged, commit with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
  - [ ] Run `git log` for commit history
- [ ] Adding new features
  - [ ] Create a new branch with `git branch <name>` with the name "modulus-op" or something similar
  - [ ] View all branches with `git branch -a`
  - [ ] Switch to a branch with `git checkout <branch name>`, check with `git branch`
  - [ ] Make all the changes and commits as you like
  - [ ] When feature is complete, switch back to the master branch with previous commands
  - [ ] Then merge the branch with `git merge <branch>`
  - [ ] If branch is no longer needed, delete it with `git branch -d <branch name>`
- [ ] Other features
  - [ ] `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Licenses
  - [ ] VS Code integration? (doesnt do a whole lot, more exploration needed)
