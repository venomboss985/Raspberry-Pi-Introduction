# Things to go over

- [ ] Remote repositories
  - [ ] Run `git remote -v` to check if local repository has a linked remote repository
  - [ ] `git fetch` will grab any remote commits to the local repository
  - [ ] `git merge` will merge the corresponding remote branch to the current local branch
  - [ ] `git pull` is effectively fetch + merge in one command
  - [ ] `git pull origin <branch>` to specify a branch
  - [ ] Make changes, branches, commits, etc.
  - [ ] Once everything is ready to go to the main repo, use `git push`
- [ ] PRs (pull requests)
  - [ ] /shrug
- [ ] GitHub Actions?
